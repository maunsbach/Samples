# Non-Linear Friction Sound Synthesis
This is the synthesis of a mechanical oscillator dircretized using the trapezoidal rule, elimination of delay-free loops with the K method and approximation of non-linearity using the Newton-Rhapson algorithm.

### MatLab
The MatLab file can be run as a single offline instance of the synthesis.

### C++
The C++ code is implemented in Unity's Native Audio Plugin SDK framework to be built as a Unity Mixer plugin.
